# 💧 Water Reminder

A simple zero knowledge reminder for your healthy habits. No external URL/Service will called

#### Why? 🤷‍♂️
A friend ask me a simple script for his habit. He tried a paid app, but unfortunately he asked for a refund.
Then i decided to use Mac OS Automator and AppleScript to help him.

#### How can i use?
[Download here (.zip)](https://github.com/Owanesh/Water-Reminder/releases) and move it into your `Application` folder, as usual. Then open it

#### How it works?
For 8 hours, once per hour, app will display a notification
