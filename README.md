A simple zero knowledge reminder for your healthy habits. No external URL/Service will called

#### Why? 🤷‍♂️
A friend ask me a simple script for his habit. He tried a paid app, but unfortunately he asked for a refund.
Then i decided to use Mac OS Automator and AppleScript to help him.

#### How it works?
For 8 hours, once per hour, app will display a notification

#### #sharingiscaring ⭐️
Feel free to fork and update this script/app, share on socials and star this repo
